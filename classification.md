# Project Title: Strawberry Authenticity Detection with FTIR Spectroscopy Data

## Project Overview:
In this collaborative project, our team is taking on the challenge of distinguishing real strawberries from imposters. The imposters could be adulterated strawberries or even entirely different fruits. Leveraging Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling, our primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively tell whether a strawberry is genuine or not.

## Dataset Highlights:
1. Training Dataset: It consists of 613 samples.
2. Testing Dataset: This dataset includes 370 samples.
3. Dataset Length: In total, we're working with 235 data points.
4. Data Dimensionality: The data is one-dimensional.
5. Classes:
  Class 1: Authentic Strawberries
  Class 2: Non-Strawberry Counterparts (which includes adulterated strawberries and other fruits).

## Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: We start by acquiring and preparing the data. This involves cleaning, normalizing, and getting the data ready for machine learning.

Feature Extraction: We extract relevant features from the FTIR spectroscopy data. Techniques like spectral analysis, peak detection, and statistical moments are applied.

Model Building: This is where we focus on creating a classification model to differentiate between real strawberries and non-strawberry counterparts.
  a. Basic Classifier: We're starting by building an initial classification model using methods like logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines. This sets a performance baseline.
  b. Deep Learning Model: We're also exploring deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), designed for one-dimensional data.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We do this for both the training and testing datasets.

Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tune the model's parameters and architecture. This includes adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and activation functions to make the model perform better.

Cross-Validation: We implement K-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model is robust and can generalize well, preventing overfitting.

Model Interpretability: Beyond classification, we're also exploring ways to interpret the model's decisions. This involves understanding feature importance, creating saliency maps, and using gradient-based approaches to gain insight into how the model makes its decisions.

As a team, we're dedicated to improving strawberry authenticity detection using FTIR spectroscopy data. We're excited to share our work on GitHub to foster collaboration and drive progress in this field.
