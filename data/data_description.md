# Classification Dataset: Strawberry

Description: This dataset is used for classification tasks and focuses on identifying authentic strawberries versus non-strawberry counterparts, which can include adulterated strawberries and various other fruits. The data is collected using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling.

Dataset Size: The dataset used for training contains 613 samples, and the testing dataset has 370 samples. Additionally, there is a dataset length of 235.

Classes: There are two distinct classes in this dataset, which likely represent "strawberries" and "non-strawberries."

Dimensionality: The dataset has a single dimension, which means it is composed of one-dimensional data.

# Regression Dataset: Appliances Energy Consumption

Description: This dataset is designed for regression tasks and aims to predict the energy consumption of appliances within a low-energy building. The data is multivariate and time-series, with 19735 instances and 29 real feature types. It covers approximately 4.5 months of data, recorded at 10-minute intervals.

Data Sources: The dataset incorporates various data sources, including temperature and humidity conditions monitored using a ZigBee wireless sensor network, energy data logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters, and weather data from a nearby airport weather station.

Additional Information: There are two random variables included for testing regression models and filtering out non-predictive attributes.

These datasets serve different purposes, with the "Strawberry" dataset being suitable for classification tasks, particularly in the context of food authentication, and the "Appliances Energy Consumption" dataset being useful for regression tasks, especially for predicting energy usage in a building. Depending on your goals and objectives, you can select the appropriate dataset for your specific machine learning or data analysis project.
