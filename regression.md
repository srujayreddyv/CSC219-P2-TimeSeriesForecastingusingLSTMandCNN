# Time Series Forecasting using LSTM and CNN for Regression

## Project Overview:
In this second part of our project, we continue our exploration of time series forecasting using deep learning techniques. Our goal is to build and evaluate regression models for time series data. We employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict numerical values based on historical data.

## Uploaded Dataset:
Our project commences with the acquisition of a comprehensive dataset that serves as the cornerstone of our regression task. This dataset is tailored for regression purposes and centers on forecasting the energy consumption of appliances within a low-energy building. It is a multifaceted, time-series dataset consisting of 19735 instances and 29 real feature types. The data spans approximately 4.5 months, with observations recorded at 10-minute intervals.

## Data Preprocessing:
Before applying any machine learning techniques, we conduct data preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. This phase includes:
  1. Checking for null values.
  2. Checking for duplicate values.
  3. Dropping unnecessary columns, such as date and target variable (Y).

## LSTM Model:
In the subsequent part, we focus on building LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for time series forecasting. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for handling sequences of data, making them well-suited for time series analysis. Notable steps in the LSTM model building process include:

  1.Designing the network architecture.
  2.Training the model.
  3.Monitoring training progress and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
  4.Saving the best-performing model.
  5.Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics.
  6.Visualizing the regression results.

Efficient N for LSTM Model:
This part also involves the determination of an efficient sequence number (N) for the LSTM model. Adjusting the sequence length can impact the model's ability to capture patterns in the data.

## LSTM Model with Bidirectional and Attention Layers:
To further enhance the LSTM model's capabilities, we experiment with adding Bidirectional and Attention layers to the network. These architectural modifications can potentially improve the model's performance in capturing complex dependencies in the time series data.

## CNN Model:
A significant part of this project focuses on applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for regression tasks on time series data. The process involves:

  1.Preprocessing the data to fit the CNN model, which includes reshaping the data.
  2.Constructing a CNN model for regression.
  3.Training the CNN model.
  4.Monitoring training progress and implementing early stopping.
  5.Saving the best-performing CNN model.
  6.valuating the CNN model's performance and visualizing the regression results.

## Efficient N for CNN Model:
This part also involves the determination of an efficient sequence number (N) for the CNN model. Adjusting the sequence length can impact the model's ability to capture patterns in the data.

The second part of our project dives into the world of time series forecasting with regression techniques. By employing LSTM and CNN models, we aim to predict numerical values based on historical data, making this project an exciting journey through the world of deep learning for time series analysis. Stay tuned for further updates as we delve deeper into the exploration of these advanced models.
